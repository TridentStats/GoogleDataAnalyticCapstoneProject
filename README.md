# GoogleDataAnalyticCapstoneProject

This repo contains the R code I used to perform the analysis and create the data visualizations within my Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Course offered by
Coursera.

Most of the code is containsed within the finalCapstoneProjectCode.R file, except for all code used to created data visualizations, which is within the
CapstoneProjectDataVisualisations.R file.
