# GoogleDataAnalyticCapstoneProject

This repo contains the R code I used to perform the analysis and create the data visualizations within my Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Course offered by Coursera.

Most of the code is contained within the finalCapstoneProjectCode.R file, except for all code used to created data visualizations, which is within the CapstoneProjectDataVisualisations.R file. You will have to run the finalCapstoneProjectCode.R file first in order for the data visualizations file to run successfully.
